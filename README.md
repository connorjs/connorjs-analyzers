# connorjs-analyzers

My personal .NET analyzer package.

Includes `StyleCop.Analyzers` and `SonarAnalyzer.CSharp` analyzer packages.
Configures rules in a `.globalconfig` file.
Turns off all rules that conflict with `CSharpier`.

Also includes .NET build properties such as `UseArtifactsOutput` and C#â€™s `Nullable`.
